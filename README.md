# Upgrade

I've had this idea for awhile. An open world FPS game in a world somewhat similar to Stalker, or Cyberpunk, or Mad Max..or Dune. Kind of a mix of all of them. I'm currently writing my 'backstory' piece for this, so I at least have a larger foundation to work upon, but I'm mostly working under these few core concepts of the game:

## Core Concepts
- The planet is dying, and has been in those stages for some time. Oceans depleted, lakes and aquifers sucked dry; life is less about living and more about surviving. Livestock dead from dehydration, plants sapped of their life. Everything and *everyone* is your sustainable.
- When value is put upon something, such as water, divides happen between people who have it and people who don't. The previously 'green rich' of this rock now hide themselves in mega-structures, where they have water abundantly. Flaunting it in fountains, man-made indoor rivers and waterfalls. They send their machines out to collect people to desiccate them of their fluids, to recycle them into drinking water.
- However, that power is not theirs alone. You must do the same to survive. Scavenge, kill and feed upon anything and anyone you see. Search the wastelands for materials you can use to upgrade not only your guns, but yourself. 

There's much more about this game I have to think about, flesh out and write about. So much to consider. A planet with no water has no atmosphere, therefore no pressure. Oxygen tanks would therefore be necessary, as well as pressurized suits. So I think setting the story in the earlier stages of a dissipated atmosphere would be best. You still wear oxygen to breathe, but no suits. Also..sound is different. In a thinner atmosphere, sounds become almost 'low-passed.' So there's a lot of strange things to think about and story implications they would bring up.

If we're talking about a genre, think mil-sim. I want a venture into these wastelands to be extremely dangerous. Planning what mechanical modifications you put on your legs or eyes, what guns to bring and how much oxygen you need. Maybe you take up space in your inventory to bring tools, so that you may upgrade your weapon and yourself on the fly, at a time penalty of course. I want every adventure to be thought out. 

Now, this is where things get out of hand if they weren't already.

I want this game to be open..and I mean *open*. I'm talking if you see a building, you can enter it. If it's 69 stories tall, than it's 69 fucking stories tall, go climb it. If you see a door, there's a room behind it, and if there's a room behind it, there's loot in it. I understand the scope of that and what issues that brings. However, I do see a light at the end of the tunnel for *one* very specific reason.

### Boomer-shooters

How is that relevant? Well, graphically. Everyone wants to play the end-all-be-all *gorgeous, sprawling open-world action-adventure* game of their dreams, but lets keep it somewhat realistic here. No way you can have a game with that scope and those graphics together. The amount of money/time I'd have to dedicate to art would be astronomical. Besides, I'm a terrible artist. So, this is where boomer-shooters come into play. They're fun, they're great, and that's the kind of art I can do.

I'm already versed in Trenchbroom while using it for [HYPERVIOLENT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1409200/HYPERVIOLENT/), so building rooms and maps should be relatively quick. 3D modeling and animating will be my downfall, however, so..we'll see. 


# WITH THAT BEING SAID

I do not aim to create this whole game in the immediate. Creating in chunks is the best way to do things, and right now i will start with the third core concept I had talked about, and an even further reduced version of that concept.

```sh
You will walk around a desert, scavenging pieces to upgrade your leg. 
A real old, messed up looking leg made from rusty iron. 
Finding different hinges, foot pads and springs to upgrade yourself, so that you may go out and find more. 
```

After this, we'll work on upgrading weapons, gun-play and exploration mechanics. I'll try to do my best updating project boards and stuff, but while I'm by myself, it may be a bit more of a .. weekly thing.

# I will post the story, world building, art, maps etc etc here as well for the larger project as I go along. Stay here for both. :)

Follow me, help me, shoot me a message. Whatever you'd like! It's public for now, however that will change eventually.
